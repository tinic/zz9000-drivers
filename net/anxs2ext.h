 * "absent" and gets no flag; IPv6 UDP checksum 0 is invalid.  A frame the

 * This is a private extension between an opener and a driver, not a SANA-II

 * does not borrow S2_Dummy or any of Commodore's buffer-hook offsets.
 *
 * The opener zeroes the record, writes VERSION, sizeof(record), Request and
 * the two receive callbacks, then supplies a pointer to it as ti_Data.  A
 * driver accepts only a Version it knows -- exactly 3 -- and a Size of at
 * least ANXD_S2_EXTENSION_SIZE, and writes Accepted as
 * the intersection it can honour for the selected unit.  An ordinary driver
 * ignores the tag and leaves Accepted zero.  Only the first valid record in
 * a taglist is taken; a later ANXD_S2_EXTENSION tag is ignored.
 *
 * Version 3 is frozen: the fields below, their offsets and their meaning do
 * not change.  Later fields may be appended after TxFlags under the same
 * Version; a driver reads one only when Size covers it, and never past
 * Size.  A change of meaning to any field below gets a new Version, which a
 * driver that does not know it ignores like an unknown tag.
 *
 * The record, callback code and every object the callbacks inspect remain
 * valid until CloseDevice().  Receive callbacks can run from the driver's
 * interrupt/server/vertical-blank service context and must not block.  The
 * transmit callback can also run while a queued write is advanced from such
 * a context.  All fields are native big-endian m68k ABI values; this is an
 * in-process driver interface, not a wire format.

 * the rest, a driver that knows this command leaves those frames where they
 * are and delivers them the next time reads are posted: at its next

 * cannot hold a frame for a late read answers S2ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED, and on

 * is the OS team's).  That block is not an allocation: these numbers mean
 * what this header says only to an opener whose ANXD negotiation succeeded;
 * any other opener must not send them.  $8191 is reserved and

/* ANXD_CMD_RX_CAPACITY: "how much may a peer put on the wire at once?"

 * Answered in ios2_DataLength: an ADVISORY receive window for this unit, in
 * bytes of received frames -- without flow control, what the unit's own
 * receive memory holds at line rate while nobody drains it (the ring or FIFO
 * after which the next frame is lost).  It is advice for the opener's
 * window, not a hardware register: a driver may answer a measured value
 * where that is what keeps the unit lossless (PAUSE, below).  0 means "no
 * advice", whether the limit is unknown or absent.  The value is per unit
 * and shared by every opener and every connection on it: an opener running
 * several flows should keep the sum of their windows within it rather than
 * grant it to each.
 * Quick, no arguments, io_Error 0; IOERR_NOCMD from a driver that does not
 * know it.
 *
 * The answer can change while the unit is online.  A card whose link has
 * IEEE 802.3x PAUSE agreed is not limited by its ring: the partner holds
 * what the ring cannot take.  It answers what it measured best with the
 * partner pausing for it, NOT 0 -- a paused X-Surf 100 was slower at 64
 * frames than at 32 -- and its ring again when a renegotiation loses PAUSE.
 * An opener that keeps a window to the answer asks again while traffic
 * flows (sana2_rx.c, at most once a second).  A smaller answer cannot take
 * back window already advertised: the opener stops offering more than the
 * new value from then on and lets the old right edge be consumed.
 *
 * What an opener does with it: keep the TCP window it advertises on that
 * interface inside the number, so a peer on the same LAN cannot put more
 * on the wire at once than the card can take.  Measured 2026-09-16 on an
 * A3000 (25 MHz 68030) with an X-Surf 100: a 100,352-byte window against

/* ANXD_CMD_RX_BATCH: many frames for one IORequest.
 *
 * What it is for.  A CMD_READ carries one frame, so at a gigabit every
 * frame is a ReplyMsg() and a Signal() from the driver, then a GetMsg() and
 * a BeginIO() from the reader: four Exec calls of list work per 1.5 KB, on
 * the receive path, with the driver's own pass still masked around the
 * first two.  This command makes the unit of I/O the driver's pass instead
 * of the frame, with nothing but the ordinary Exec request contract: one
 * queued IORequest, one ReplyMsg() when it is answered.
 *
 * The request.  io_Command ANXD_CMD_RX_BATCH, ios2_PacketType the type it
 * accepts, ios2_Data a pointer to an AnxdS2RxBatch the opener owns, with
 * Version ANXD_S2_RX_BATCH_VERSION, Size covering Count cookies, Count > 0
 * and Filled 0.  An accepted batch is always queued (IOF_QUICK is cleared
 * as for CMD_READ) and answered on mn_ReplyPort like any read; a batch
 * refused at once (bad record, unsupported) may complete quick with its
 * error.  Each
 * cookie is what the opener's RxDirect/RxFilled pair receive as ios2_data
 * for that slot, exactly as they receive a CMD_READ's ios2_Data today; the
 * opener therefore needs ANXD_S2F_RX_DIRECT and ANXD_S2F_RX_LINK_HDR
 * accepted, because a batch has no per-frame ios2_SrcAddr/DstAddr/
 * PacketType: the 14-byte link header written in front of each payload is
 * the frame's whole identity.  The driver fills Cookie[0], Cookie[1], ...
 * in arrival order, one RxDirect() then one RxFilled() per frame (with the
 * failed-copy exception under RxDirect), and writes Filled.  A frame the direct path cannot take (a second opener's
 * read of the same type, a core without a direct claim) is copied into
 * the slot through the opener's S2_CopyToBuff instead, then reported by
 * RxFilled() without ANXD_S2_RXF_SUMMED.  An opener with a filter hook, or
 * a raw one, is refused (S2ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED): neither has a request to
 * judge or fill.
 *
 * When it is answered.  The driver replies the request with io_Error 0 the
 * moment Filled reaches Count, and otherwise at the end of the service pass
 * (interrupt, poll or blank) that filled the first slot: no frame waits in
 * a batch for a later pass, and a pass that took a burst of N frames costs
 * one reply.  A batch with Filled 0 is not answered until a frame comes.
 * AbortIO(), CMD_FLUSH and CloseDevice() answer it IOERR_ABORTED and the
 * unit going offline S2ERR_OUTOFSERVICE, each with Filled as it stood:
 * those frames are complete and delivered.
 *
 * Posting.  Two batches per type keep the driver fed while the reader is
 * working through one; a batch counts as one posted read of its type for
 * "who takes this type", so a second opener's CMD_READ of the same type
 * still turns the direct path off for both, as it does today.  A driver
 * that does not know the command answers IOERR_NOCMD; an opener that did
 * not get ANXD_S2F_RX_BATCH accepted posts CMD_READs as before. */
